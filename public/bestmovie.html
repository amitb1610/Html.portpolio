<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>This movie shows how a powerful "LOVE" can start a great war and change destiny of thousands ppl. We see Achilles who cared about no-one but himself, fell in love finally and we could see love in his shinny eyes (u know which scene I mean, not to spoil) it has a really great BALANCE over emotions, war, family, royalty and superstitions. those who say characters were too stone-hearted I must say that real war is like that! and this movie showed us very very great. I have watched this more than 5 times and still this is the best historical film (though it might not be completely faithful to iliad) and I would recommend this to everyone! I wish there was another powerful movie like this for ODDYSSEY</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Three Idiots is a groundbreaking Bollywood hit that was released ahead of its time. This film is a comedy with great acting, unique characters, a complex plot, and, most importantly, a very inspiring film about choosing the correct route in life.</p>

<h3>PK</h3>
<p>A superb movie asking all us all to take care of humanity rather than just religion. Because humanity is the religion we must care about before anything else.Once again, Aamir Khan (actor) takes away all the limelight and Cool to see Shushant Singh Rajput act beautifully.
    Anushka sharma pokes fun when she runs after Amir Khan, alien in the movie. She has done a very beautiful work as a journalist. The movie clearly  portrays all your Doubts about God's existence,Which God to Believe.!! Though the cocept of movie have been copied from 2012 movie "oh my god".A must watch. If not for fun then for the content it presents. The ambiguity of our societies and the unexplained norms or barriers are explicitly shown to generate evolutionary thoughts. Definitely 5 stars.</p>
